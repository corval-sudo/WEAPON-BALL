# Where to resume

Status:
- Deterministic sim core extracted to src/simCore.ts
- Node CLI runner still works (npm run sim)
- Vite viewer renders real sim tick-by-tick with speed control
- matchSpec.json loaded from repo root
- Phase 4 (viewer MVP) functional

Next logical options:
1) Phase 4 polish (HP bars, hit flashes, timeline)
2) Freeze v0.1 sim spec + simVersion
3) Begin Phase 5 design (Ball NFT + match/betting contracts)
4) Return to Phase 3 to build advanced weapon logic
5) Discuss aesthetic considerations
6) Reasses arena size, health points, the size of the balls

Last discussed direction:
- Pausing before Phase 4 polish / Phase 5
